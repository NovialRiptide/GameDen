# GameDen Rewrite
**Please do not use this game engine.** 
A game engine specifically made with physics in mind. 
There will be no new features added to this game engine,
if there are recent commits, they were either dependency fixes
or cleanup.

why did I upload this to GitHub? There are several projects that
are privated on my profile that uses this game engine, but for my
own sake I decided to private them.

Check out Gravity: https://github.com/novialriptide/Gravity

*Made with pymunk==5.6.0 and pygame==2.0.0.dev10*
